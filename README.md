# rainfall-rescue

Data made openly available from the RainfallRescue.org project

In the DATA/ folder there is a different directory for each location which contains identified sheets of data for a particular decade from that location. Filenames with 'ERROR_' at the start indicate that there is still a disagreement or incorrect sum in one or more columns which needs resolving.

Some locations include multiple sheets per decade, indicating potentially different rain gauges being used or a misplaced sheet.

All the original PDFs for these '10-year sheets' are available from the Met Office Digital Archives: https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/SO_d383374a-91c3-4a7b-ba96-41b81cfb9d67/
The filenames for each location indicate which PDF file the original page came from.
