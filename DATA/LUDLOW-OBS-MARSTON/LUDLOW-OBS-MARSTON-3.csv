NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,
"NGR is north end of Gravel Hill and even here the altitudes do not match. Observer C B Marston moved gauge in 1927 to South Cot (assume to be cottage) not sure where this is but the church relationship suggests 400 to 500 yards east. The gauge moved in 1930 to Hill Crest, a separate record.",,,,,,,,,,,
