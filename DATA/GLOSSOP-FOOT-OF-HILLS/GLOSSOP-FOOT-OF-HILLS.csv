NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NGR is on the Hurst Brook at about the right altitude. The name Hurst appears on the record and the area east of Glossop has many references to Hurst including Hurst Reservoir, which was built about the time of the observations and it is assumed the readings to do with the construction of the reservoir. May not fit the Foot of Hills description and the gauge could be 1km East, particularly as the stated altitude has a ? after it on the records..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Combined readings given for Jan - Jun 1839 =15.75 , Jan - Jun 1840 = 21.2 and Jul to Dec 1840 = 24",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1840s record has the following readings 47.22 for the period 15 Dec 1842 to 14 Dec 1843 and 36.2 for the period 15 Dec 1843 to 31 Dec 1844,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There is a note on the 1840s record ""1840 is said elsewhere to be only 10.5 months"", but no clues as to where elsewhere was!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
