NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NGR is 300 yards west of of church as noted on the record sheet. The gauge moved to Lockinge Estate Office, renamed Kitson Gardesn, in Aptil 1935, the records stated the move was quarter of a mile, however, the distance between locations is 600m which suggests the location may be +/- 200m. Altitudes match. The station number was used for both locations",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
