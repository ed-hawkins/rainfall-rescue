"NGR is Woodbank but the gauge moved several times during it's life up to 0.5 miles SW with stated altitude up to 700 ft. The observer is the same as for Lightoaks and the Woodbank gauge appears to have moved around the locality of Lightoaks and may be the same location as Lightoaks for part of the time. NGR varies and could be up to 1km, S, to SW. The 2 Woodbank gauges may not be in the same location",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
