# This sheet's location and station number are a little confusing.,,,,,,,,,,
"# This sheet, labelled 'Brigg Sugar Factory', shares the same station number (2571/8) as 1940s and 1950s sheets labelled 'Brigg Scawby Hall'.",,,,,,,,,,
"# A note on this 1930s sheet says the gauge moved one mile north-east in 1940, becoming station 2571/9.",,,,,,,,,,
# 2571/9 is the station number for 1940s and 1950s sheets labelled Brigg Sugar Factory (handled separately).,,,,,,,,,,
"# The railway station and church directions are not precise, but they put this site (2571/8) closer to Scawby Hall than 2571/9 is.",,,,,,,,,,
# But the low altitude value might indicate a location near to the River Ancholme.,,,,,,,,,,
# Scawby Hall is used as an indicative grid reference for the site.,,,,,,,,,,
