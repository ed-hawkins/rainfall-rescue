# There were two gauges running in parallel for 1889 and 1893-1896.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"# In 1889 a Snowdon gauge was introduced, and from then on formed the main record for the site.",,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,
# The location information on the sheets is contradictory about whether the gauge is in [Great] Driffield or Little Driffield.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"# The sheet titles all refer to Driffield York Road, and the census gives 3 York Road as the observer address.",,,,,,,,,,,,
# With York Road being in Driffield rather than Little Driffield.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"# But the church directions on the sheet mention Little Driffield church explicitly, and so put the gauge on the eastern edge of Little Driffield.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"# Grid references for the two locations are: TA020581 (York Road) and TA012580 (Little Driffield), about 1km to the west.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"# Based on the directions, the Little Driffield site is assumed to be where the gauge was located, and its grid reference has been used.",,,,,,,,,,,,
