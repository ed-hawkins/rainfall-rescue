# The observer Mr Collins is the same observer as for the Galen House site.,,,,,,,,,,
# The directions associated with the gauge place it in the Galen House area.,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,
# A comment on the 1920s sheet says that the gauge moved 1 1/4 miles west on March 26th 1929.,,,,,,,,,,
"# If this comment is accurate, then the first 18 months of this sequence are for the initial site, somewhere to the west of Woodhall Spa.",,,,,,,,,,
# There's no detail of where the initial site may have been. Possibly the covered reservoir at TF212640 ?,,,,,,,,,,
