# Sand Hill Farm is about 3km south-west of Holme-on-Spalding-Moor.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"# Sand Hill Farm is not named on the sheets, but the 1861 census lists the observer at this location.",,,,,,,,,,,,
# The 1860's sheet has latitude/longitude figures which correspond closely to Sand Hill Farm.,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,
# The 1867 readings for this site are duplicated exactly in the unrelated Preston Holme Slack site in Lancashire.,,,,,,,,,,,,
# This seems likely to be caused by confusion in the distant past over which 'Holme' site the readings related to.,,,,,,,,,,,,
# The 1867 annual total is much more typical of Sand Hill Farm than Preston Holme Slack's yearly rainfall.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"# The Preston Holme Slack site has no further readings beyond 1867, whereas Sand Hill Farm continues for a few more years.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"# It seems likely that the duplicated readings belong to Sand Hill Farm, and have been misapplied to Preston Holme Slack.",,,,,,,,,,,,
