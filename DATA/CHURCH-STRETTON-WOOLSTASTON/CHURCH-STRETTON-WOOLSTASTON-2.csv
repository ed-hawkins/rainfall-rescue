NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Originally all of these records 1870 to 1960 were considered as the same station no 2284 called CHURCH STRETTON WOOLSTASTON, however, the gauge was moved in Feb 1939 about 0.5 miles according to the note on the record sheet, therefore the records have been split",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The records for 1865 to Jan 1939 have been given station number 2284/01 and RECTORY added to the name to reflect the gauge's positon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The station number and name have been kept for the records from Feb 1939 to 1960 in case there are records from that site beyond 1960,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note the record sheet states the gauge was moved in Feb 1939 and I have assumed the last reading at the rectory site was Jan 1939, it could have been Feb.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The 1950s record sheet records a location with grid ref of SO449981, which, whilst consistent with the move noted on the 1930s record, is  inconsistent with the altitude and location data relative to the church and railway station, the location given above is for Meadow Place, which fits the location and altitude data better but unable to verify if the observers, the Parrys, lived there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Estimated readings removed from some 1941 months and total, and there were no readings for some of the months in 1954 and 1955, which are blank",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
