NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,
"NGR is only part of site at 400 ft. and is close the buildings and is assumed to be beside the other gauge, if there was another gauge.",,,,,,,,,,,
"There are two records for 1923 to 1926 inclusive, originally the longer record duplicated the shorter record for all readings but subsequently the a lot of the readings were amended, without explanation. This record is the shorter record and  still duplicates a lot of the readings in the other record..",,,,,,,,,,,
