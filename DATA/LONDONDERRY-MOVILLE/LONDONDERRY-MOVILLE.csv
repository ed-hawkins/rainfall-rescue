"# The location is stated as being in the centre of the town, but a precise location is not known. The grid reference is in the vicinity of the cathedral.",,,,,,,,,,

"# Observer Rev. Francis Smith moved to Moville, Donegal in 1869 and continued observations there.",,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,
"# These readings, and those from Moville, are duplicated on rainfall sheets labelled as 'Stratford on Avon', also attributed to Rev. Smith.",,,,,,,,,,
"# British Rainfall almanacs for the period attribute the readings to Rev. Smith at Londonderry/Moville, with nothing to match at Stratford on Avon.",,,,,,,,,,
"# Rev. Smith was in the Londonderry/Moville area at this time, so the 'Stratford on Avon' rainfall sheets should almost certainly be disregarded.",,,,,,,,,,
