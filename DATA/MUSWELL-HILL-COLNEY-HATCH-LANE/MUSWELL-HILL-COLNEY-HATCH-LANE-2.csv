NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NGR is South West of the corner of Colney Hatch Lane and Pages Lane. There is a reference to a garden in Pages Lane on one of the sheets and the distance information and altitude point to the gauge being located here. For part of the time there were two gauges at the same location an 8 inch and 5 inch; the 5 inch has the longer record.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The 2 gauges overlap for neary 6 years  and there are 16 duplicated readings out of 69, however, the majority of the other readings differ by 0.03 inches or less, therefore the duplicated readings are probably coincidental",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
