These readings relate to rainfall sheet TYRain_1840-1849_E_pt1 page 26.,,,,,,,,,,
"The sheet heading says 'Woodhead Brinks Edge', but the word 'Woodhead' has been added later and is erroneous.",,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
"These 1847 readings appear in an 1848 report by Samuel Homersham, MS&LR engineer, to the directors of MS&LR : https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2RUHAAAAQAAJ - page 70.",,,,,,,,,,
"The heading on page 70 describes the figures as being from 'Todd's Brook, Brinks, top of hill, 1500 ft above level of sea'.",,,,,,,,,,
"The rain gauge is shown on old OS maps near Brink Farm on the southern side of Sponds Hill, above Toddbrook Reservoir. The 1500 ft elevation figure is not accurate, the site is about 200 ft lower down than this.",,,,,,,,,,
This site becomes the known as Bollington Sponds Hill on the main series of MS&LR rain sheets which start in the 1850s.,,,,,,,,,,
