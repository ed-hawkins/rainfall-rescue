NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NGR is  a nursery off West Hill Highgate. The Cutbush family, James is the observer, owned nurseries including one in Highgate and I am fairly confident that this is the right nursery. The nursery slopes significantly and the NGR is at an altitude of about 366ft as quoted on most of the records. Some later records indicate a higher altitude of around 400ft, which suggests the gauge may have moved around the site, however, amove of just under 100yards N would achieve the higher altitude.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
