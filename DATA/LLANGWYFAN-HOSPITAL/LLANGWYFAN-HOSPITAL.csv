"NGR is from the 1950s record for the other gauge on the site and is the hospital in Langwyfan. Altitudes match. The readings are noted as being taken by the farm bailiff and a different staton number suffix has been used for this gauge, therefore it might be in a differnt location.",,,,,,,,,,
The 1934 readings seem to have been exchanged between the two gauges and a note suggests the reason for this is that one gauge was more reliable than the other. Readings left in this record.,,,,,,,,,,
