"# These readings, attributed to Mr J.Norton, contain large amounts of unexplained duplication with a series of nearby sites:",,,,,,,,
# * 1869 January-August : Duplication with South Kyme,,,,,,,,
# * 1869 September-December : Duplication with Lincoln Railway Station,,,,,,,,
# * 1870 full year duplication with Lincoln Railway Station,,,,,,,,
# * 1871 January-August: Duplication with Branston Hall,,,,,,,,
# * 1871-1874 nearly all months very similar or identical to St Botolphs,,,,,,,,
"# Also 1877-1879 are crossed out duplicates of Carholme Villa in west Lincoln (SK968716), where Mr Norton was active from 1877-1889.",,,,,,,,
"# This leaves only 1875 to 1876 as non-duplicated values, with the readings from 1875 appearing in different handwriting on the sheet.",,,,,,,,
# Only readings for 1875 and 1876 have been retained. The earlier years seem to be some sort of composite site.,,,,,,,,
# British Rainfall does not list Mr Norton as an observer until his Carholme Villa readings begin in 1877.,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,
"# Note: No detailed location information given on sheets, so Grid Ref centred on street where Mr Norton was manager of mill.",,,,,,,,
