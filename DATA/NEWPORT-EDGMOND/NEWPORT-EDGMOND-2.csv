NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NGR is 20 High Street Edgmond where the observer J Bodenham lived according to the 1911 census.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There are two gauges at this location apparently located next to each other. There are a suspiciously high number of monthly results that match exactly, which suggests that readings have been duplicated either in error or because one or other of the gauges has not been read. There are 4 matches in 1907 and 1908, 3 in 1913, 8 in 1914, 5 in 1914 and 6 in 1915; the other years have 0 to 2 matches which are plausible",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
