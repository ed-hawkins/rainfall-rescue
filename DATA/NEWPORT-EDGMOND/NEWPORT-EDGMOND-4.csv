NOTES,,,,,,,,,,
"Location looks to read Newport Chatwell. There is a Great Chatwell near Newport, but  just in Staffordshire but at the wrong altitude. I think the observer is Rev W Eyre but not too  sure and cannot connect the name to Chatwell or even Newport. There is a Chadwell just inside Shropshire still at the wrong altitude and this is the NGR used, could be +/- 2 to 5 miles (NB Chatwell is 4 miles from Newport)",,,,,,,,,,
