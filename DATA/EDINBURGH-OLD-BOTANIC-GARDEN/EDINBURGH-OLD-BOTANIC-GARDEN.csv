"The observer, Dr (Daniel) Rutherford, became Professor of Botany at Edinburgh Uni and Keeper of the Royal Botanic Gardens in 1786",,,,,,,,,,
"At this time the Botanic Gardens were located in Leith Walk, moving to their current location in the 1820s.",,,,,,,,,,
Although Leith Walk is one of the longest streets in Edinburgh it also slopes quite steeply so the NGR given is at the elevation as noted on the record.,,,,,,,,,,
