"NGR is from the 1950s record. Altitudes match. The gauge is stated as moving but most of the moves noted are small. The relationships between the church and railway stations do not match, in fact, they change significantly between records implying the gauge moved more significantly, in fact, the 1950s records states the gauge moved in 1953 and 1959 but no clues as to how far but could be as much as a mile or more. The gauge started as station no. 4109/3 but was changed in  1938 when the river divisions were changed but does not mention that the gauge moved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
