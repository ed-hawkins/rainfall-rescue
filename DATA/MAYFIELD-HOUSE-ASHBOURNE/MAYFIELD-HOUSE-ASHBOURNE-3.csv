NOTES,,,,,,,,,,
NGR is from 1940 record and is Mayfield House. Altitudes match. 3 gauges but gauge 2 may actually be two gauges but all gauges are in the same location,,,,,,,,,,
"There are a few duplicated results between the gauge, which are fairly random and probably to be expected given the consistency of readings between the gauges",,,,,,,,,,
