NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NGR is Cantern Cottage, which is at the correct altitude. The observer Rev H M Stallybrass lived at Cantreyn Cottage, which does not exist on OS maps but modern maps have Cantreyn Cottage at the same location as the other Cantreyn location; there appears to be several buildings at this location so it is conceiveable that the two observers were at the same place, however, the altitudes do not match. Interestingly Cantreyn Bank is closer to the other records.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
