NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NGR is the lead works in Dyliffe at about the right altitude. There are many mine workings in Dylife and NGR could be +/-500m,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sept 1970 readings could be 17.5, but this seems implausible and the stated total does not equal the sum of monthly readings, the readings of 11.5 used makes totals match",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The observer also recorded the following readings Oct to Dec 1866 24.90, Jan to Mar 1867 14.10, Apr to Jun 1877 23.60, Jul to Sep 1867 22.5, Sep to Dec 1867 24.5 and Jan to Feb 1873 12.0",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
