Gauge was moved to Capstone Hill in May 1922 before returning to near the Pleasure Gardens in 1929 (100ft W of its original position),,,,,,,,,,
"The move was probably due to the pavilion being re-built, which was completed in 1925",,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
"No information about where the gauge was, but as this is another park area, just on a hillock between the pavilion and the sea, the NGR is on the south side, protected from the sea",,,,,,,,,,
