"# The location in Malton is uncertain. The observer Mr Slater lived at 84 Newbiggin, but that doesn't fit the directions on the sheet.",,,,,,,,,
# The directions are a reasonable match for the cemetery - this is used for the grid reference.,,,,,,,,,

# The gauge came from Old Malden in 1902. It moved to Broughton Road in July 1911.,,,,,,,,,
