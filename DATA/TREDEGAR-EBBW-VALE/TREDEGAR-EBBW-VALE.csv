"NGR is Ebbw Vale Iron Works where the original observer, Phineas James worked. Cannnot find subsequent observer, R S Jordan. Altitudes sort of match but distance from church is 2 miles not 3. NGR could be +/- 1km, or more. Gauge may have moved in 1882 because the altitude changes and there is a gap in 1881.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jan to May 1872 readings are duplicates of those for TREDEGAR SIRHOWY IRON WORKS, the observer R S Jordan was at that location until June 1872 and he obviously took over this location from Phineas James, but no information on when. It is possibe that Mr Jordan filled blanks in this record with readings from his previous location. Readings deleted from here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
