NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NGR is from 1950s record but this is not the pumping station. There is a pumping Station at TQ231780, which is now being used for the new Thames Tideway scheme. From the changing distance to church and station it seems the gauge may have moved aound the area. I think the NGR is +/- 500 yards. There is another more signifivant pumping station the other side of the Creek at TQ223783 but this does fit any of the descriptions on the sheets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
