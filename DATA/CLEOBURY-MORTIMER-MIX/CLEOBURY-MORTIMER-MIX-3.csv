NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NGR is Neen Savage Resctory, the observer is a vicar. The gauge may have moved 200 yards in 1887 or thereabouts because relationship to the church changes. The observer, Reverend Frederick Burd, was also observer at Hookfield House Bridgnorth from 1900",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nov 1896 reading duplicates The College reading, which is to be expected; there are 45 overlapping monthly readings. More concerning is that there are significant differences in monthly readings between the two sites, however, not so bad for the annual totals 5% to 10%",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
