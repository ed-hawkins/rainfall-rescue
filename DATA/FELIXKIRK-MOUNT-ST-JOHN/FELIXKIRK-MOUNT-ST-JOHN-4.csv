"# Readings for 1904-1907 look to be for a slightly different location, and possibly for a different gauge, but have been retained.",,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,
"# There were multiple gauges running in parallel at Mount St. John, and the rainfall sheet headings are confusing.",,,,,,,,,,
# Consequently the linkage of rainfall sheets into sequences presented here may not be completely correct.,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,
"# The December 1906 reading is shown with a question mark, and the total for 1906 is shown in brackets without explanation. Both have been retained.",,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,
# The readings for March-December 1907 are duplicated on a second sheet for the Mount St John site (TYRain_1900-1909_22_pt1 page 119) and have been retained.,,,,,,,,,,
