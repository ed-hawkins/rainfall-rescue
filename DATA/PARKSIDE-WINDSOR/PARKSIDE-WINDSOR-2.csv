NOTES,,,,,,,,,,
"NGR is Cumberland Lodge. Altitude is from OS maps, altitude on record of 200ft is too low",,,,,,,,,,
Jan to Sep 1867 are duplicates of Parkside also Feb 1862 is a duplicate. The 1867 sequence suggest that the readings have been copied but it is not possible to determine which is the original record. Note Parkside is about 1km East of Cumberland Lodge on the edge of Windsor Park.,,,,,,,,,,
