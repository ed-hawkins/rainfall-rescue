NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NGR is Parkside near Windsor. Altitude is from OS maps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jan to Sep 1867 are duplicates of Cumberland Lodge, an 8 year record 1862 t 1869, also Feb 1862 is a duplicate. The 1867 sequence suggest that the readings have been copied but it is not possible to determine which is the original record. Note Cumberland Lodge is about 1km West of Parkside actually in Windsor Park.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
