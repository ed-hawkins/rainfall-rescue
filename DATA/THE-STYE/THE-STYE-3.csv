# Mr Maitland set up this gauge near the original Stye A gauge in the hope of it handling snow better. But the gauge was soon abandoned.,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,
# The 1880s rainfall sheet is shared.,,,,,,,,
# Readings from this 'Short-Lived Maitland' gauge were discontinued after 1885.,,,,,,,,
# Readings shown on the sheet from 1886 onwards relate to the first years of the newly installed 'Original Stye B' gauge.,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,
# Values reported for 1880-1883 seem to have originally been presented as quarters rather than decimals.,,,,,,,,
"# They have been converted to decimals on the rainfall sheet in red ink, and these converted values are used above.",,,,,,,,
"# The single reading on the 1870s sheet, for December 1879,  has not been converted in this way on the rainfall sheet.",,,,,,,,
"# The converted value is presented above, i.e. 18.75 instead of 18.30.",,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,
"# The final reading for this gauge, December 1885, is shown in brackets on the rainfall sheet, without explanation, and has been omitted.",,,,,,,,
