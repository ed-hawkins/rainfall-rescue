There are few places within Edinburgh that reach 386'. Arthur's Seat is one but there are no buildings at that elevation around the hill and upon which the gauge could have been mounted at 79',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The nearest is in the vicinity of Calton Hill, at 349', where there are also buildings. NGR near the Observatory but highly speculative",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
